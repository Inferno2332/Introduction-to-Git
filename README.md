# Introduction-to-Git<br>
This is an introductory course on version control . We will be covering the basics of markdown, git (commands , branches etc.) , how to setup git remotes and even try building a personal page using GitHub pages. If we get time I might even cover the GitHub API.<br>
Version control is important and a hallmark of good engineering practices ! <br>
This course is meant to be carried out in 4 sessions of 1-2 hours each. Make sure you have a GitHub/GitLab/OverLeaf account before starting. We will also be using [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~) , an online IDE.<br>
