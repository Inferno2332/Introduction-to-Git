# Basics 
Version control is required to enable users to collaborate effectively on software engineering projects. In this series of workshops , we will be looking at Git , a version control system designed by Linus Torvalds (yes that guy who created Linux). We will be looking at an extremely basic idea of how to use Git (without going into the nitty-gritty stuff) in this workshop.
